<h1>Final Project</h1>

<p>
Abstract:
My project will show the environmental issue of deforestation. I will achieve this by including assets that show trees that are cut down.
I will have a mutated moose as the enemy that will chase you around the map.

<p>	Deforestation means the purposeful action of clearing forest land to make space for agriculture and obtaining wood for fuel, manufacturing, 
nd construction. Deforestation can cause more carbon dioxide being released in the atmosphere. The reason for this is because when trees are burned
they release carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere. This causes rapid climate change. It can also affect biodiversity such as animals' natural habitat
can be disrupted and cause extinction. Not only does it affect animals but plants as well. Some elements in my project are the main character and the
mutated moose. The main character is a lumberjack who upsets the mutated moose because he is causing deforestation. In this game your goal is to escape
from the mutated moose and you will have different objectives to achieve this goal. Some objectives will have you find keys to different rooms. 
Planting trees in order to unlock the keys to your car. That way you can escape the mutated moose by driving away with the car.
The objective to plant trees shows that lumberjack is showing remorse and empathy towards the environment and the mutated moose.
