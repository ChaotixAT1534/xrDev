  <h2>Reading</h2>
<p>In "An Account of Peach Blossom Spring" by Tao Yuanming, 
  It is weird that the prefecture was not able to find the route to the people
  living inside the mountain. But then the people in the mountain did say there 
  was no point in telling the outside world. The people in the mountain are 
  described just like people in the outside world. Which makes you wonder
  if he is in a different universe or crossed the afterlife. 
  In "Worlds Unfolding" edited by Amy Xiaofan Jiang, she says that virtual worlds can 
  be engaging if you include creativity and insert realities we inhabit. 
  World Making is defined as creating or reshaping a world by transforming 
  environments. Includes storytelling, cultural, political, technological, and ecological contexts. 
  Virtual space can be defined as websites, chatrooms, online platforms, gaming environment, the metaverse. 
  This reading helped me a lot to think of ways how to world build in a virtual space.
  With the help of the exercise it allow me to imagine a new world that I would have never thought of. </p>
