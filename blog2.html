<h1>Blog 2</h1>

<p>In "Hamlet on the Holodeck" by Janet H. Murray, the author talks about 
  his experience with coding. Janet teaches in MIT since 1971 and did not go 
  back to coding until early 1980s. Janet loves literature and she finds
  coding interesting because it is like learning a new language. 
  This is true because from my experience on coding HTML, I would have to 
  find the base structure of HTML before you can include any text. 
  Janet says that we are living in a historic transition where cyberliterature is 
  applied to many websites, video games, and more. I find it interesting that
  literature is everywhere because I play a lot of video games and there 
  is always a story when it comes to characters or world building. 
  There can be a story behind the towns you go in games or a story
  on the weapon you recieve in a game. It is really amazing how literature
  impacts world building. </p>
