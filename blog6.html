<h1>Blog 6</h1>
<p> 
In chapter 4 the author talks about immersion, the experience of being transported to a stimulated place.
  A time I felt I was in immersion was when I was around eight years old and I went to my cousin’s house. 
  He had a Wii in his house and he was playing New Super Mario Bros. Wii, it was my first time playing on the Wii.
  When I played the game it felt like I was in the game and I was stuck on it for hours. I really like the multiplayer option 
  in the game because it really adds to the fun and enjoyment. The Wii remote adds in features like audio and vibration.
  Whenever you shake the controller it vibrates, mimicking the characters jumping and doing a 360 degree jump.
  An example the author said was a children’s picture book named, Harold and the Purple Crayon, Harold has a purple crayon and draws different things.
  He draws his own immersive world and makes his own fantasy.
