	In Chapter 6, the author talks about “Transformation” and she defines it as digital environments 
offering narrative expression. An example from the book that shows transformation is “Game of Thrones,”
there are thirty significant characters and it follows multiple story arcs. Some spoilers from the show, 
when they kill off major characters it shifts perspectives of the story and the story becomes engaging 
without being all over the place. A game I played that does something similar is called “Street Fighter 6”
and playing story mode gives you different worlds you have to travel to meet the characters. 
This changes perspectives depending where you go. Some examples are going to New York, Jamaica,
Japan, and etc… The characters give you a quest to do while getting to know more about their backstory.
