In Chapter 5, the author discusses agency, the power to take meaningful action and see the results of decisions and choices.
  In other words it can be participatory like story games. I watched videos of people playing a story game called “The Quarry”
  and this game is multiplayer and you can choose different options on the actions and conversation you want to say. 
  The choices you make in the game lead to different outcomes. Since this game is a horror game the characters can 
  die if you do not perform well during intense counters with the killer. You have to time the correct button on your
  controller or keyboard or else you die. I found this chapter really interesting because the idea of agency does play
  in many games, story telling, and media.
