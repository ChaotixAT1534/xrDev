<h1>Blog 4</h1>
<p>According to the author went from the printing press to movie cameras,
  radio and etc... Stories have evolved and the author analyzes the film,
  Back to the Future. The film is more than just science fiction because
  it is a wish fullfillment narrative that covers themes like fate and identity. 
  One point she makes is multiforms stories often reflects different points 
  of view of the same event. There are different ways stories can be viewed 
  because Marvel Comics uses "What If...?" to explore different questions 
  and surprisingly canon to the story. She thinks that interactive designs 
  in spatial narrative can change point of view. For example, a 2D horror
  game can not be as terrifying and experienced the same as a 3D game. 
  It depends on the perspective to make narratives interactive.  </p>
